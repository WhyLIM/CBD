In earlier versions of CBD, all of the biomarkers and their information are collected from PubMed database with the key words:

```
(((((biomarker [Title/Abstract]) OR marker [Title/Abstract]) OR indicator [Title/Abstract]) OR predictor [Title/Abstract])) AND ((((((colorectal cancer [Title/Abstract]) OR rectal cancer [Title/Abstract]) OR bowel cancer [Title/Abstract])))).
```

Now we have made a comprehensive update in terms of content and visual in CBD2. As shown in Figure. 2, our sorting of the articles has gone through the following steps:

1. Remove nonexperimental articles such as interview, editorial, erratum and not in English paper;
2. Manually read the titles and abstracts of the articles to exclude results that did not fit our theme, were incomplete, and had results that were not statistically significant.

![Figure 3. Data collection procedure](../images/workflow.png "Figure 3. Data Collection Procedure")

Finally, 690 original articles were included in this update through manual full-text reading and group discussion, and the total number of biomarkers has reached to 2439. CBD2 expands the biological categories of biomarkers to DNA, RNA, protein, metabolite, microbiome, image, and others, and expands the clinical categories to prediction, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. CBD2 also includes the reported objects that can not be biomarkers for CRC, which were defined as non-biomarkers in the database. The distribution of biomarker categories in CBD2 is shown in Figure 1A.

In this update, a total of 690 original articles were included through manual full-text reading and group discussion, resulting in the expansion of the biomarker database to encompass 2439 biomarkers. CBD2 has broadened the biological categories of biomarkers to include DNA, RNA, protein, metabolite, microbiome, image, and other areas, and extended the clinical categories to include prediction, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Additionally, CBD2 also includes a comprehensive list of reported objects that do not meet the criteria for being considered biomarkers for colorectal cancer, and these are defined as non-biomarkers in the database. Figure 1A illustrates the distribution of biomarker categories in CBD2.

Total 1134 records included 870 different biomarkers from 1115 articles were collected in CBD, which were separated into four kinds according to the different biology source: Protein, RNA, DNA and Other Biomarker.

Currently 650,285 samples are included in CBD2, 245,116 males and 208,392 females, with no gender information provided for the remaining samples.(Figure 6)

CBD continues CRC biomarker researches from 451 different cities of 83 countries, which from 6 Continents: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America. Figure 7 shows the distribution of researches according to continents. Also we selected the top 100 cities with most number of researches to map on the Bing map, from which you can scan the CRC biomarker research situation in city level (Figure 8). Figure 9 presents the top 20 most number researches cities worldwide.

Also, we separated the samples inside CBD into Asian and Non-Asian race to research the different and similar things in different races, and the result of which are presented in Figure 10. An interesting phenomenon is that research numbers for Asian race is more than Non-Asian race (a), but the amount of people the opposite (b). From figure 10c and 10d you can compare the different of most used biomarkers in Asian and Non-Asian race.

Meanwhile we calculated the cancer location of each concluded research, and the number of colon, rectum cancer are showed in figure 11, from which we can see that most of research (770) studied both colon and rectum.

![Figure 11. Number about cancer location](../images/location.png "Figure 11. Number about cancer location")

Precisely, we summarized the research with sample mean age and accurate amount to calculate the final mean age of our all samples. And the result is presented in figure 12.

![Figure 12. Proceduce for mean age calcultate](https://cbd.limina.top/images/old/age.png "Figure 12. Proceduce for mean age calcultate")

Meanwhile we also counted the relative cancer stage from these biomarker researches showed in Figure 13.

The source where the biomarkers come from were also calculated, showing in Figure 14a and from which we can see that most of the biomarkers are from tissue(66%), blood(17%) and cell line(13%). Also the result shows that people like to use molecular biology together with clinical experiment to study CRC biomarkers since the cell line is often been used together with blood and tissue(Figure 14b).

For the function of biomarkers in our database, we also made professional statistic by summarizing them into three types: Diagnostic biomarker, therapeutic biomarker, and prognostic biomarker. (Figure 15)

As we all know, experiment method is very important to a research, we also summarized the experiment used by each research. Figure 16 showed the experiment methods which were used more than 5 times.
